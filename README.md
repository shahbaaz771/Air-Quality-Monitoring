# Air-Quality-Monitoring

This project presents a low-cost Air Quality Monitor using Arduino Nano which can monitor the air quality of a room using MQ135 air quality sensor. 

It also measures the room temperature and humidity using DHT11 and shows the data on an OLED display. 

The main objective of this project is to monitor the quality of air which can be used to check whether our house/car/city is within the prescribed limits of air quality.
